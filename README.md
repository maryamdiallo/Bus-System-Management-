# Bus-System-Management-
The bus reservation system's goal is to provide passengers with an effective and user-friendly platform for booking bus tickets, viewing schedules, and managing seat reservations. The system includes a variety of features, including user management, which allows passengers to register as either non-admin users or administrators. Admins control bus agencies, schedules, and bus data, whereas non-admin users can book and access trip information. The database design includes critical functionality including storing user information, bus information, agency information, routes, and driver information. The system also keeps track of ticket bookings, seat reservations, and trip times, delivering real-time data to users and administrators. Finally, the project attempts to improve the bus reservation process by making it more organized, transparent, and accessible to all stakeholders.
